EXPERIMENT:

Setup:
- alternatively: random peep loses random friend (pick random edge), random peep befriends a friend of friend (unless it's self or already a friend)
// hoooooopefully the implementation doesn't matter too much.

Prediction:
- they'll split into two smaller groups, but stay stable after that.
- also, Ziph-y distribution in friendships???

TRIAL ONE:
They totally disintegrate into loners.
I think this might be because of the way it's implemented.
For losing a friend, let's make that pick a random peep first.

TRAIL 2:
Still disintegrates...
Let's make "making friends" 3x more likely than losing a friend.

TRIAL 3:
3x more likely -- Ohhhhhhhh almost had a split society, but then coelesced into ONE ball, with five loners off in the wind.
Another run -- still one ball w/ some loners
Another run -- ooooh ALMOST TWO BALLS, just connected by ONE. ONNNNNNNE PEEP.
2x more likely -- disintegrate :( with a quad-ret hanging around.
2.5x more likely -- same as 3x.
another run - same
another run - TWO SEPARATE BALLS BRIEFLY. But one of them quickly disintegrated.

TRIAL 4:
3x more likely, but with MORE PEEPS. FIFTY PEEPS NOW.
YAY
TWO SELF-SUSTAINING BALLS
// huh. So there is a certain GROUP SIZE possibility in ABSOLUTE NUMBERS, dependent on the rules. hm.

IS IT ZIPHIAN???
...
no.
No it's not.
If anything it's disturbingly linear.
